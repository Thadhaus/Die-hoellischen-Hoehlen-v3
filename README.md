# Höllische Höhlen
Erkunde die Höhlen! - Explore the caves!

This is a fun textadventure to demonstrate a generated world.
Find it on [repl.it](https://replit.com/@GeduldigeBirne/Die-hollischen-Hohlen#main.py)

You may walk around and take the lichens to survive a little longer.
Maybe you'll find the exit from the caves, then you can escape this torture of ever changing paths.

ToDo: 
1. Add achievments for finding gems of different kinds
2. Place some random keys in the caves, so the locked doors need their own key
3. Fix the directions generated so the 'pray' function can be removed. To do so check for each room all six directions and make sure that they are not all 'None'
